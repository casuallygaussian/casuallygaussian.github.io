My name is Rodrigo Ferreira and I am a Data-Scientist.
**I love all things data**: Machine-Learning, Econometrics and Programming are areas I delve into every day to produce meaningful business solutions.

I created this blog to share to organize in one place useful new stuff I learn, to share new thoughts, and above all to share my my nerdiest side.

If you have you interesting Data-Science, Statistics and AI topics you want to discuss do not hesitate to reach-out!

Cheers!
